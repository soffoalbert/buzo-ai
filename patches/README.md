# React Native C++20 Configuration

This project uses C++20 standard for all React Native components.

Instead of patching individual files to be compatible with C++17, we've set the entire project to use C++20 in the Podfile, which simplifies the build process and ensures compatibility with all React Native components that use C++20 features.
