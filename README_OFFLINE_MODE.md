# Offline Mode Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of offline functionality in the Buzo AI Financial Assistant app.

## Overview

The offline mode allows users to continue using the app even when they don't have an internet connection. Key features include:

- Local storage of essential data (budgets, expenses, savings goals, transactions)
- Automatic synchronization when the device comes back online
- Visual indicators of offline status and pending changes
- Manual synchronization option

## Components

### 1. Offline Storage Service (`offlineStorage.ts`)

The core service that handles storing and retrieving data from AsyncStorage:

- Provides functions to save, load, and remove data
- Manages a queue of pending changes to be synchronized
- Detects network status changes
- Stores timestamps for synchronization

### 2. Synchronization Service (`syncService.ts`)

Handles the synchronization of data between local storage and the backend:

- Pushes pending changes to the backend when online
- Pulls latest data from the backend
- Manages synchronization conflicts
- Provides functions for manual synchronization

### 3. Offline Status Bar (`OfflineStatusBar.tsx`)

A UI component that displays the current offline status:

- Shows online/offline status
- Displays the number of pending changes
- Shows the last synchronization time
- Provides a button for manual synchronization

### 4. Testing Utilities (`testOfflineMode.ts`)

Utilities for testing the offline functionality:

- Functions to generate mock data
- Tools to simulate network status changes
- Methods to clear offline data

## Usage

### Initialization

The offline mode is initialized in the `App.tsx` file:

```javascript
// Initialize sync service
syncServiceCleanup.current = syncService.initializeSyncService();
```

### Adding Data Offline

When adding data while offline:

1. Data is saved to local storage
2. A pending sync item is added to the queue
3. The UI is updated to show pending changes

### Synchronization

Synchronization happens:

- Automatically when the device comes back online
- When the user manually triggers a sync
- During app initialization

## Testing

To test the offline functionality:

1. Go to Settings > Developer > Offline Mode Testing
2. Use the provided tools to:
   - Add mock data
   - Toggle network status (simulation)
   - Manually sync data
   - Clear offline data

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow

1. User creates/updates data
2. Data is saved to local storage
3. If online, data is immediately sent to the backend
4. If offline, data is added to the pending sync queue
5. When the device comes back online, pending changes are synchronized

### Conflict Resolution

When conflicts occur during synchronization:

1. The most recent change is prioritized
2. Users are notified of conflicts when necessary
3. Critical data is preserved in both versions

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced conflict resolution strategies
- Selective synchronization for bandwidth optimization
- Background synchronization
- Compression of offline data for storage efficiency
