## Implementation Details

### User Model

The User model has been extended to include subscription information:

```typescript
export interface User {
  // ... existing fields ...
  subscription?: SubscriptionInfo;
}

export enum SubscriptionTier {
  FREE = 'free',
  PREMIUM = 'premium'
}

export interface SubscriptionInfo {
  tier: SubscriptionTier;
  startDate?: string;
  endDate?: string;
  autoRenew?: boolean;
  paymentMethod?: string;
  lastPaymentDate?: string;
  nextPaymentDate?: string;
  transactionHistory?: SubscriptionTransaction[];
}

export interface SubscriptionTransaction {
  id: string;
  date: string;
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  status: 'successful' | 'failed' | 'pending' | 'refunded';
  paymentMethod: string;
  description: string;
}
```

### Subscription Service

The `subscriptionService.ts` file contains the core functionality for managing subscriptions:

- `getUserSubscription()`: Get the current user's subscription information
- `hasPremiumAccess()`: Check if the user has premium access
- `updateSubscription()`: Update the user's subscription information
- `processSubscriptionPayment()`: Process a subscription payment
- `cancelPremiumSubscription()`: Cancel the user's premium subscription
- `getPremiumFeatures()`: Get the list of premium features

### Premium Feature Access Control

The `premiumFeatures.ts` utility provides functions to check and control access to premium features:

- `isPremiumFeature()`: Check if a feature is premium
- `hasAccessToFeature()`: Check if the user has access to a premium feature
- `showPremiumFeatureUpsell()`: Show a premium feature upsell alert
- `accessPremiumFeature()`: Wrapper function to access a premium feature

### Subscription UI

The `SubscriptionScreen.tsx` file implements the subscription management UI:

- Display current subscription status
- Show available subscription plans
- Handle subscription purchase and cancellation
- Display premium features

### Integration with Existing Screens

Premium feature access control has been integrated into the following screens:

- **AIAdvisorScreen**: Personalized financial coaching is a premium feature
- **ExpenseAnalyticsScreen**: Detailed analytics is a premium feature
- **SettingsScreen**: Updated to link to the subscription screen

## Payment Processing

The current implementation simulates payment processing. In a production environment, this would be integrated with a payment gateway like Stripe, PayPal, or a local payment provider.

To implement a real payment gateway:

1. Add the appropriate payment gateway SDK to the project
2. Update the `processSubscriptionPayment()` function in `subscriptionService.ts` to use the payment gateway
3. Implement webhook handlers for payment events (success, failure, etc.)
4. Add server-side validation of subscription status

## Future Enhancements

- Implement promotional codes and discounts
- Add family/group subscription plans
- Implement subscription tiers with different feature sets
- Add subscription analytics to track conversion and retention
- Implement subscription renewal reminders
