# Offline Mode Testing Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive testing plan for the offline functionality in the Buzo AI app. The goal is to ensure that users can perform all critical operations while offline and that data synchronization works properly when connectivity is restored.

## Test Objectives

1. Verify that users can perform all critical operations while offline
2. Ensure data synchronization works properly when connectivity is restored
3. Confirm that the offline status is clearly indicated to users
4. Test error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Test Environment Setup

1. Use the OfflineTestScreen to simulate network conditions
2. Test on both iOS and Android devices
3. Test with various network conditions (slow, intermittent, completely offline)

## Test Cases

### 1. Basic Offline Functionality

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| 1.1 | Toggle device to offline mode | Offline status bar appears with "Offline" indicator |
| 1.2 | Create a new budget while offline | Budget is saved locally and appears in the list |
| 1.3 | Create a new expense while offline | Expense is saved locally and appears in the list |
| 1.4 | Create a new savings goal while offline | Savings goal is saved locally and appears in the list |
| 1.5 | Edit existing data while offline | Changes are saved locally |
| 1.6 | Delete existing data while offline | Items are removed locally |

### 2. Data Synchronization

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| 2.1 | Create multiple items offline, then restore connectivity | Items are synchronized with the backend when online |
| 2.2 | Edit items offline, then restore connectivity | Changes are synchronized with the backend when online |
| 2.3 | Delete items offline, then restore connectivity | Deletions are synchronized with the backend when online |
| 2.4 | Perform mixed operations (create, edit, delete) offline, then restore connectivity | All changes are synchronized in the correct order |
| 2.5 | Toggle between online and offline multiple times | Sync queue maintains integrity and syncs correctly |

### 3. UI Indicators

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| 3.1 | Go offline | Offline status bar appears with correct status |
| 3.2 | Create items offline | Pending changes count increases in the status bar |
| 3.3 | Go online and sync | Sync progress is shown and pending count decreases |
| 3.4 | Simulate sync failure | Error status is shown with retry option |
| 3.5 | Check all screens for offline indicators | All screens should show consistent offline status |

### 4. Error Handling

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| 4.1 | Simulate sync failure | App handles failure gracefully and shows error |
| 4.2 | Retry failed sync | App attempts to sync again and shows progress |
| 4.3 | Create conflicting data (same item modified online and offline) | App resolves conflict according to conflict resolution strategy |
| 4.4 | Sync with server error (5xx) | App retries with exponential backoff |
| 4.5 | Sync with client error (4xx) | App shows appropriate error and allows manual resolution |

### 5. Performance and Edge Cases

| Test Case | Steps | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| 5.1 | Create large number of items offline (50+) | App handles large sync queue efficiently |
| 5.2 | Test with slow network connection | Sync completes successfully, with appropriate timeout handling |
| 5.3 | Test with intermittent connectivity | Sync resumes where it left off when connection is restored |
| 5.4 | Test app restart while offline | Offline data and pending changes persist |
| 5.5 | Test app restart during sync | Sync resumes correctly after restart |

## Testing Tools

1. **OfflineTestScreen**: Use this screen to simulate network conditions and test offline functionality
2. **Network Throttling**: Use browser dev tools or network simulation tools to test with slow connections
3. **Airplane Mode**: Toggle device airplane mode to simulate complete network loss
4. **Backend Mocking**: Use mock backend responses to simulate various error conditions

## Test Execution

1. Run through all test cases manually
2. Document any issues found
3. Fix issues and retest
4. Consider automating critical test cases for regression testing

## Success Criteria

The offline functionality will be considered successful if:

1. Users can perform all critical operations while offline
2. Data synchronizes correctly when connectivity is restored
3. The app clearly indicates offline status and sync progress
4. The app handles errors gracefully and provides recovery options
5. Performance remains acceptable with large amounts of offline data
