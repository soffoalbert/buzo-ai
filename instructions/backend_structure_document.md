# Backend Structure Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the backend design and infrastructure for an AI-powered personal finance assistant specifically built for South African youth. The backend is responsible for securely managing all data, supporting the mobile application's budgeting, expense tracking, and personalized financial advice features, and ensuring that every piece of user information is handled according to the high standards of data privacy and security. The choices made in building this backend reflect the need for reliability, scalability, and responsiveness, all while addressing the unique financial and connectivity challenges in the region.

## Backend Architecture

The backend is designed with a cloud-first approach that leverages modern, serverless practices to simplify scalability and maintenance. Supabase acts as the central nervous system for data storage, user authentication, and secure access, while additional functionality such as receipt scanning and the ingestion of bank statement data is handled by specialized services that integrate seamlessly into the overall framework. This architecture emphasizes modularity so that each component – from the AI advice engine powered by GPT-4o to the custom endpoints for financial data entry – can be updated independently. The system is built to adapt to changing user data volumes, ensuring optimal performance even as the number of users grows.

## Database Management

The project uses Supabase as its primary backend service, which provides a robust database solution based on PostgreSQL. All user financial data including budgets, transaction records, and personalized advice logs are stored securely within this system. The data is encrypted at rest using AES-256, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected. Data structuring is straightforward, with tables organized around user profiles, transactions, budgets, and AI-generated insights. This careful organization makes it easy to retrieve and analyze data in real time, which supports both the real-time financial advice capabilities of the app and efficient synchronization in offline scenarios.

## API Design and Endpoints

The backend exposes a set of carefully designed APIs that allow the mobile application to communicate securely and efficiently with the server. These APIs follow RESTful design principles, enabling clear and logical endpoints for core operations such as user authentication, data submission, receipt scanning results, and retrieval of personalized financial advice. Each endpoint is designed to validate input thoroughly and to return data in a consistent, easy-to-handle format. This ensures that the mobile app, whether uploading bank statements or manually entering expense details, always receives accurate and timely responses that enable dynamic user interactions.

## Hosting Solutions

The backend is hosted using modern cloud providers that offer reliable and scalable solutions tailored to mobile applications with real-time requirements. By relying on cloud-based infrastructure, the service benefits from high availability, cost-effective resource management, and the flexibility to scale up during peak usage times. The use of robust CI/CD pipelines and tools like Expo for integrated deployment ensures that backend changes can be rolled out smoothly with minimal downtime. This hosting arrangement is specifically chosen to support users who may often face low-bandwidth conditions, ensuring that essential services remain accessible even under challenging network conditions.

## Infrastructure Components

The overall backend infrastructure is built with several key components in mind. Load balancers are used to distribute incoming requests evenly, which helps prevent any one server from becoming a bottleneck. Caching mechanisms are in place to reduce the time required for frequently accessed data, such as user profile details and recurring financial insights. The integration of content delivery networks (CDNs) ensures that static content and assets load quickly regardless of the user's device or geographical location. Each of these components plays a critical role in maintaining a fast, responsive experience for users, while also supporting the system’s need to operate effectively in both online and offline modes.

## Security Measures

Given the sensitive nature of financial data, the backend implements a layered security approach. For data in transit, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used to ensure that all communications between the client and server are securely encrypted. Data at rest is protected using AES-256 encryption in the Supabase database, ensuring that stored financial information remains inaccessible to unauthorized parties. User authentication is handled securely via Supabase, which supports multi-factor authentication for an added layer of protection. Regular security audits and strict access control mechanisms further help safeguard user data and ensure that the system complies with all relevant privacy regulations.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Continuous monitoring is essential to ensure that the backend remains reliable and performs optimally. A variety of tools and practices are employed to keep track of system performance, including logging frameworks that capture errors and usage statistics in real time. Alerts are triggered for any performance degradation or anomalous behavior, ensuring rapid response from the development or operations team. Additionally, scheduled maintenance and routine updates keep the system current with the latest security patches and performance improvements. This proactive approach to maintenance ensures that the backend remains robust, secure, and efficient over time, even as user needs evolve.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

The backend structure for this AI-powered financial assistant is designed to offer a secure, scalable, and resilient foundation for the application. By leveraging Supabase for database management and authentication, utilizing RESTful APIs to enable smooth communication between the mobile app and the server, and integrating a suite of modern cloud hosting and infrastructure components, the system meets the high demands of real-time financial data processing in a secure environment. The layered security measures and extensive monitoring practices further enhance reliability while ensuring full compliance with data protection standards. Overall, this backend is not only equipped to handle current user demands but is also primed to evolve as the app grows, ensuring that the financial needs of South African youth are met with utmost precision and care.
