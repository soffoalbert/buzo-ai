# Tech Stack Document

## Introduction

This project is an AI-powered personal finance assistant designed to help South African youth manage their finances more efficiently. The tool offers personalized budgeting, expense tracking, and savings insights, all tailored to address both the unique economic conditions and cultural realities of Africa. With a focus on ease of use and data security, the app assists users in setting financial goals, tracking daily transactions from receipts and bank statements, and receiving actionable advice driven by advanced AI algorithms.

## Frontend Technologies

The project uses React Native paired with TypeScript to develop a mobile application that works seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices. By leveraging React Native, the development process is streamlined and allows for a cross-platform experience, ensuring that the app is accessible to a wide audience. The use of modern design principles, supported by Expo as a development tool, ensures that the user interface is both responsive and visually engaging. This results in an intuitive and culturally resonant experience that is easy to navigate, even for users with minimal technical expertise.

## Backend Technologies

On the backend, Supabase acts as the central hub for data management and user authentication. It securely handles the storage of financial information using AES-256 encryption for data at rest, while TLS is implemented to safeguard data in transit. The integration of Supabase ensures that user data is both secure and efficiently managed. Additionally, the AI component, GPT-4o, processes user financial data to generate personalized advice and budget recommendations. This powerful combination of data management and real-time AI insights results in a robust system that supports a wide array of features from receipt scanning to dynamic expense categorization.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The hosting and deployment infrastructure is designed with reliability and scalability in mind. The project utilizes CI/CD pipelines and version control systems that ensure steady releases and streamlined updates. Tools like Expo simplify the deployment process, making it easier to push updates and manage cross-platform compatibility. This infrastructure choice means that the app can handle increasing numbers of users over time, while maintaining chronic compliance with security protocols and providing a smooth user experience in low-bandwidth or challenging network conditions.

## Third-Party Integrations

The financial assistant benefits from the smart integration of third-party services. GPT-4o is centrally used to generate real-time, tailored advice based on the user’s financial data. The receipt scanning functionality, enabled by the mobile device’s camera, allows automatic logging of expenses to enhance data accuracy. Furthermore, another layer of integration exists where users can upload their bank statements to enrich the assistant's understanding of existing spending patterns. These integrations collectively enable the app to offer highly personalized financial recommendations that are both data-driven and contextually relevant.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Data security is a critical aspect of the project. Robust encryption techniques such as TLS for data in transit and AES-256 for data stored in Supabase are employed to ensure that sensitive financial information is well-protected. The app also incorporates secure authentication measures, including multi-factor authentication provided by Supabase, to prevent unauthorized access. On the performance side, the application is optimized for low-bandwidth environments by incorporating offline capabilities. Users can continue to access and log financial data even without an active internet connection, with all data synchronizing once connectivity is restored. These measures ensure both high performance and peace of mind for users concerned about the security of their personal data.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

The technology choices made in this project combine modern, reliable, and secure approaches to create an app that is both user-friendly and powerful. By using React Native and TypeScript, the frontend ensures seamless cross-platform performance and an engaging user experience. Supabase, with its robust security features, underpins the backend and secures sensitive data while providing efficient authentication and data storage solutions. The integration of GPT-4o brings advanced AI capabilities into the mix, allowing the app to offer personalized financial advice. Together, these technologies create a cohesive and scalable ecosystem that aligns with the project’s goals of enhancing financial literacy and management for South African youth. Unique aspects of this tech stack, such as offline functionality and AI personalization, position the project to address the specific challenges of the target demographic, making it a standout solution in personal finance management.
