# App Flow Document

## Introduction

This application is an AI-powered personal finance assistant specifically designed for South African youth to better manage their money. The app guides users through budgeting, expense tracking, and setting savings goals with advice tailored to their unique economic challenges. The focus is on providing personalized financial recommendations based on data collected from scanned receipts, uploaded bank statements, and manual entries. The design and content are culturally relevant, with vibrant visuals that appeal to a younger African audience, and the system is built using modern technologies to ensure both security and ease of use.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user launches the app for the first time, they are welcomed by a friendly onboarding experience that clearly explains the core features of the application. The journey starts with a series of screens that describe how the budgeting, expense tracking, and savings goal sections work. During onboarding, users are encouraged to set up their account by either signing up with their email or using social login if available. They are also prompted to upload their bank statements and allowed to scan receipts with their phone camera. This data helps the AI generate personalized recommendations based on their financial history. The sign-in process is streamlined, and options to recover lost passwords or to sign out are integrated into the app’s authentication system to ensure that even non-technical users can easily navigate account management.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After successful login, users are taken directly to the home screen, which serves as a central dashboard summarizing their financial status. The screen displays key widgets including a quick overview of their budgets, current savings, and recent transactions. The layout is simple and intuitive, featuring clearly labeled navigation tabs that allow users to switch between different sections of the app. Whether the user wishes to review their budget plans, check detailed expense logs, or explore educational content on personal finance, the home screen provides direct access to each of these areas. The design ensures that any user, regardless of their financial literacy level, can confidently find the information they need with minimal steps.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Once on the dashboard, users can enter specific modules by tapping on relevant sections. For budgeting, users are taken to a detailed budget management screen where they can create new budgets by specifying their income, setting spending limits, and choosing from common categories such as groceries, transportation, housing, and education. The system also allows creation of custom categories for personalized tracking. As users input spending data, visual feedback alerts them as they approach their budget limits, making adjustments seamless and interactive. The expense tracking module is equally detailed, offering a page where users can immediately log expenses. This process includes options to scan receipts using the mobile camera, manually enter expenses, or even upload bank statements. The app’s intelligent algorithm categorizes each expense automatically, ensuring accurate record keeping and analysis of spending patterns. Moving on to savings, users can set and manage savings goals via a dedicated savings goal screen. This page provides interactive progress indicators and motivational insights based on user activity to help sustain their saving habits. Additionally, the educational resources section hosts a range of interactive articles, videos, and tips aimed at improving financial literacy. Throughout the app, page transitions are designed with simplicity in mind, using intuitive navigation so that users can move quickly from one feature to another without confusion. The system also integrates in-app push notifications that alert users to budget thresholds, progress updates, and any unusual activities detected within their financial data.

## Settings and Account Management

Users can access the settings menu from any page within the app, and this section is dedicated to personal information management, notification preferences, and subscription settings. In the account management area, users have the opportunity to update profile details, change their password, and manage two-factor authentication for enhanced security. The settings also provide a clear breakdown of subscription tiers, enabling users to upgrade from the free version to the premium service if they desire additional features such as more detailed spending analysis and priority support. From the settings, users can easily return to the main dashboard, ensuring that even while managing their account configurations, they remain connected to the core financial management experience of the app.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application has been designed with multiple fallback mechanisms to handle error states and alternate user paths gracefully. If a user enters invalid data during registration or while updating their account, clear error messages are immediately displayed with prompts on how to correct the mistake. In the event of connectivity issues, the app transitions to an offline mode where users can still access previously loaded data and log new expenses. Once connectivity is restored, the app automatically synchronizes all changes to the central database. If a user attempts to access restricted features without the required permissions, the system displays informative messages that guide them on how to gain access, whether through account verification or subscription upgrade. These robust safeguards ensure that users are always informed of any issues and can quickly return to a normal working state without losing important financial data.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The user’s journey in this app begins with a welcoming onboarding experience that emphasizes the importance of early data input via receipt scanning and bank statement uploads. After registration, the smooth transition to a clear and intuitive dashboard empowers users to track their budgets, monitor their expenses, and set practical savings goals. Detailed feature flows ensure that every component, from budget planning to financial education, is deeply interconnected and easy to navigate. Account settings allow for effortless management of personal information and subscription preferences, while robust error-handling mechanisms safeguard against data input mistakes and connectivity issues. Ultimately, the app’s mission is to help young Africans make better financial decisions by providing personalized guidance, effective tools, and engaging educational content in a secure and user-friendly environment.
