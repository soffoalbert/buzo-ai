# AI-Powered Personal Finance Assistant Implementation Plan

This plan is divided into 5 phases: Environment Setup, Frontend Development, Backend Development, Integration, and Deployment. Each step is based on the PRD, Tech Stack, and App Flow documents to ensure that all requirements are met.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  **Step 1 (PRD Section 5 & Tech Stack):** Install Node.js (latest LTS version as required by Expo) and Expo CLI. Verify installation by running `node -v` and `expo --version`.

2.  **Step 2 (PRD Section 5):** Initialize a new Expo project using React Native with TypeScript. Run: `expo init FinanceAssistant --template expo-template-blank-typescript` in your working directory.

3.  **Step 3 (PRD Section 8 & Implementation Plan):** Create the following directory structure within the project root:

    *   `/src/screens` (for screen components)
    *   `/src/components` (for reusable UI components)
    *   `/src/services` (for API integrations and service utilities)
    *   `/src/assets` (for images, icons, and branding assets)

4.  **Step 4 (PRD Section 1 & Implementation Plan):** Initialize a Git repository and create `main` and `dev` branches. Enable branch protection rules on GitHub.

5.  **Step 5 (PRD Section 6):** Run `expo doctor` to validate the environment setup and confirm that all required tools are properly installed.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  **Step 6 (App Flow: Onboarding):** Create the Onboarding screen at `/src/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx`. Include UI elements to explain app benefits, instructions for scanning receipts and uploading bank statements, and account setup flows.
2.  **Step 7 (App Flow: Home Screen):** Create the Home Screen (dashboard) at `/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` that displays budget overview, savings progress, and recent transactions.
3.  **Step 8 (App Flow: Budget Planning Flow):** Create the Budget Management screen at `/src/screens/BudgetScreen.tsx`. Implement input fields for income, spending limits, and both preset (e.g., groceries, transportation) and custom categories.
4.  **Step 9 (App Flow: Expense Tracking Journey):** Develop the Expense Tracking screen at `/src/screens/ExpenseScreen.tsx`. Integrate a component for receipt scanning using Expo’s Camera API at `/src/components/ReceiptScanner.tsx` and provide manual input fields for expense entries.
5.  **Step 10 (App Flow: Savings Goals):** Build the Savings Goal screen at `/src/screens/SavingsScreen.tsx`. Include UI elements to set targets, display progress, and offer motivational insights.
6.  **Step 11 (PRD Section 4 & Q&A):** Develop a Financial Education screen at `/src/screens/EducationScreen.tsx` to display interactive articles and video content, using the vibrant color scheme and culturally relevant design.
7.  **Step 12 (App Flow: Notifications):** Integrate in-app push notifications by adding Expo Notifications in `/src/services/notifications.ts`. Configure it to alert users about budget limits and progress updates.
8.  **Step 13 (PRD Section 7):** Implement offline mode by caching key data (budgets, expenses, savings) using local storage (e.g., AsyncStorage) at `/src/services/offlineStorage.ts`. Validate functionality by simulating data entry in airplane mode.
9.  **Step 14 (Validation):** Run the app in Expo client on mobile simulators (iOS and Android) to ensure that all screens load correctly and UI components behave as expected.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  **Step 15 (PRD Section 5 & Tech Stack):** Create a Supabase project via the Supabase dashboard. Set up authentication (with multi-factor support) and configure a new database with tables for Users, Expenses, Budgets, SavingsGoals, and Transactions.

2.  **Step 16 (PRD Section 4):** Define the database schema in Supabase with appropriate fields for each table ensuring data integrity. Document schema fields and constraints for future reference.

3.  **Step 17 (PRD Section 5 & Q&A):** Configure security in Supabase by enforcing TLS for data in transit and AES-256 for data at rest. Document these settings in the project’s README.

4.  **Step 18 (Tech Stack & Core Features):** Develop API integration functions in `/src/services/api.ts` to handle:

    *   Receipt image uploads
    *   Bank statement file uploads
    *   Data synchronization for offline mode (upon reconnect)

5.  **Step 19 (Core Features):** Set up service integration with GPT-4o for personalized financial advice at `/src/services/aiAdvisor.ts`. Use API keys (ensure secure storage in environment variables) to call the GPT-4o endpoint and pass user data for analysis.

6.  **Step 20 (Validation):** Use Supabase’s interface and API testing tools to validate endpoints (test by posting sample expense data and verifying proper insertion and retrieval).

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  **Step 21 (App Flow & PRD Section 7):** Integrate Supabase authentication into the React Native app by updating `/src/services/auth.ts` to include login, sign-up, and multi-factor authentication flows.
2.  **Step 22 (App Flow: Onboarding & Core Features):** Connect the onboarding flow to backend endpoints by invoking API calls from the Onboarding screen for receipt scanning and bank statement uploads. Ensure data is forwarded for GPT-4o analysis.
3.  **Step 23 (App Flow: Real-Time Updates):** Integrate API calls in the Budget, Expense, and Savings screens to fetch and update user data from Supabase. Use `/src/services/api.ts` functions for CRUD operations.
4.  **Step 24 (Validation):** Simulate end-to-end interactions (register user, upload receipt, retrieve personalized advice) to verify that frontend API calls correctly communicate with the Supabase backend and GPT-4o service.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  **Step 25 (Deployment & PRD Section 6):** Configure environment variables for production (API keys, Supabase URL, etc.) and update Expo’s `app.json` with production settings.
2.  **Step 26 (Deployment):** Build production versions of the app for iOS and Android using Expo’s build service (`expo build:ios` and `expo build:android`).
3.  **Step 27 (Deployment & Tech Stack):** Set up the final CI/CD configuration (if applicable) on your repository to automatically build and test the app on new commits. Ensure tests for key functionalities (authentication, data synchronization, and AI advice generation) are all passing.
4.  **Step 28 (Validation):** Deploy the application in a staging environment and run a set of manual and automated tests (using Expo’s Testing Library and real-device testing) to confirm all end-to-end functionalities including offline mode and push notifications.

This implementation plan follows the technical requirements outlined in the provided documents and ensures that every major feature and integration point is clearly addressed.
